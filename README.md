# MNIST Digit Classification with PCA and Distance Metrics

This Python notebook is for an assignment on digit classification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and two distance metrics, namely Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, on the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification. It contains a large number of labeled images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, and is widely used for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## PCA and Distance Metrics
PCA is used in this notebook to reduce the dimensionality of the image data, which can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of the classification model. Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances are employed as distance metrics to measure the similarity between images, which can aid in identifying patterns and discriminating between digits.

## Experiment
The notebook showcases a successful experiment where two digits in a single 28x28 input image are recognized. The experiment utilizes code that automatically splits the input image if it detects the presence of two digits, allowing for accurate classification of each digit separately.
